Contributing
============

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository
before making a change.

Code Style
----------
Please adhere to PEP8 style guidelines unless called out in this document.
1. Add 3 lines of whitespace between classes and free functions.
2. Prefer 2 lines of whitespace between methods within classes.
3. Prefer all methods in classes should have an explicit `return` statement.
4. All `pytest` tests shoud `return 0` if the test is successful.
5. Conform to Google-style docstrings except for where it might break Sphinx
   formatting.
6. Lines should not exceed 120 columns except in cases where it reduces the
   readability of the code.

### Auto-formatting
We can also use the [YAPF][2] tool to perform auto-formatting.
The .style.yapf file provides a formatting scheme that is also good. Using this
breaks (2) above, it will only add 1 line between method definitions so this should
be adjusted manually.

Versioning
----------
This project uses [Semantic Versioning][1].

Merge Request Process
---------------------
1. Ensure any unapproved install or build dependencies are removed before submitting
   a merge request.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md file with details of the changes you are making.
3. Update relevant documentation in the `doc/` folder and any appropriate _docstrings_.
4. Update unit tests to fully test your additions. We aim for 100% coverage on this project.
5. Ensure unit tests and documentation build cleanly by running `exec-tests.sh`, `exec-makedoc.sh`
   and the _example_ applications in the repository.
6. Run the `exec-reformat.py` script in the repository's root directory to update all formatting
   using the **[YAPF][2]** tool. This is optional but STRONGLY encouraged, we reserve the right to
   reject a merge request if this hasn't been run.
